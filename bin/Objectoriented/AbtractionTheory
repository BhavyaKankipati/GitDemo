Abstract Classes :

Abstract method: methods does not have unimplemented methods
Concrete method: methods having body

we cannot instantiate abstract class, means cannot create object for abstract class. child classes are forced to implement abstract methods of parent class


Interface :

1.interface contains only abstract methods
2.Access specifiers should be public

3.variables defined must be public static,final
4.To implement interface we must use "implements" keyword


Abstract class:

1.Abstract class contains abstract methods, concrete method or both
2.Except private we can have any access specifier for methods in abstract classes
3. Extends keyword is used to extending abstract class




Page Object Pattern:

->Easy to maintain
->Easy Readability of scripts
->Reduce or Eliminate duplicacy
->Reusability of code
->Reliability
